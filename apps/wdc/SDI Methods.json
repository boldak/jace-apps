Technical revolution in the field of\n    information-communication technologies has made\n    the world policy more transparent and led to an increase in changes influence which occurred in one\n    region and affected the other parts of the planet.\n    Due to these new qualities of the globalized world\n    it became clear that new geopolitical system is full\n    of unstable, unsuccessful and weak countries. The\n    weakening of retaining mechanisms peculiar to bipolar world and conflict exacerbation between fundamental values of different countries caused a new\n    wave of opposition, terrorism, violence, territorial\n    claims and irregular development.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n   Uncontrolled spread of nuclear, chemical and\n    biological weapon, rebuilding of nuclear energetics\n    in such unstable, unbalanced world significantly increases the threat to sustainable development and\n    global security of mankind.\n\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n   Under such conditions the stabilization of world\n    development becomes possible due to the international cooperation, \n    investments and support to the weak countries and planet regions by the progress\n    of new paradigms of «harmonious coexistence» or\n    «tolerant, peaceful world». In order to accomplish\n    such global, stabilizing policy the recognized international organizations and scientific centers began\n    to develop analytical instruments for the estimation\n    of new developing tendencies of the world since the\n    beginning of this century. The first attempt to control the tendencies of the global development was a\n    series of reports «The world and the conflict» which\n    were published in the University of Maryland State\n    (USA) in 2001. Similar reports devoted to the global tendencies of world development were also published in many countries such as Spain, Canada, and\n    Germany etc.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    The final aim of the development of new analytical instruments was the attempt to estimate the\n    ability of different countries to act in such important dimensions as conflict, state administration,\n    economic and social development. Among all these\n    instruments «The index of ability of the peaceful\n    society development» that belongs to the series of\n    reports «The world and conflict», «Indicators of the\n    world management» developed by the World Bank\n    and «Index of unsuccessfulness of the countries»\n    developed by The Fund of Peace can be mentioned. \n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    For the quantitative estimation of the sustainable development threat in our research the Fragile States Index (FSI) produced by The Fund for\n    Peace (FFP) is used (http://ffp.statesindex.org).\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    This index is based on the twelve indicators that\n    cover a wide range of state failure risk elements\n    such as extensive corruption and criminal behavior, inability to collect taxes or otherwise draw on\n    citizen support, large-scale involuntary dislocation\n    of the population, sharp economic decline, groupbased inequality, institutionalized persecution or\n    discrimination, severe demographic pressures, brain\n    drain, and environmental decay..

Corruption perception (CP).</b> Corruption is the biggest obstacle to the economic and social development of society. It endangers every change. Corruption has become not only\n    one of the main reasons of poverty but also a source\n    which prevents its overcoming. Although corruption had existed for a \n    long time it became more\n    widely spread in the process of globalization at the\n    end of the XX at the beginning of the XXI centuries.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n  Corruption in one country had negative impact on the development of other countries which\n    means that countries with the high level of corruption are not limited to the Third World. The process of liberalization in the former socialist countries was accompanied by unprecedented abuse of\n    power in 90-ies. Thus, Financial Times proclaimed\n    1995 to be «the year of corruption». The following\n    years were marked with the spread of this phenomenon almost throughout all countries of the\n    world and corruption itself became global and international character.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    Wellbeing did not become the prerequisite of\n    successful elimination of corruption.

The daily growth of Earth population exceeds 162 thousand people [5]. According to the method of arithmetic extrapolation the\n    Earth population will have been 9,75 billion people\n    by the year 2050. That is why the first threat appears to be related to the fact that the Earth will be\n    inhabited by the number of people that will exceed its abilities to sustain on the basis of the present\n    natural resources. The japanese experts believe\n    that the real problems for the mankind will be connected with the catastrophic shortage of water, energy, foodstuff that can cause new conflicts on the\n    Earth [6].\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    Nature can satisfy human requirements for business activity and only if this activity is restricted\n    to the biosphere renewable capacity on the populated areas of the planet. Estimations of the ecologically disturbed areas (Ecological Footprint) [5]\n    gives the possibility to establish the environmental\n    standards for the world economics by which the\n    biosphere capacity (Biocapacity), its goods and\n    services, can not be exceeded. These standards help\n    people, organizations and government to create\n    strategies, establish the goals and direct the process\n    in compliance with the requirements of the sustainable development.\n    Ecologically disturbed territory (Ecological\n    Footprint) is defined as a bioloigically productive\n    area which sustains people at the current level of\n    consumption, consideting the level of technological development and environmental assets. The\n    unit of measurement of this average estimation of\n    area is global hectare. The most substantial component of the Ecological Footprint is the territory of\n    the Earth used for foodstuff production, forest area,\n    biofuel amount, ocean (seas) territory, used for fishing and the most important element is the \n    Earth area, necessary to support the life of plants absorbing the emissions of \n    <span style=\"font-size:1.1em;\">\n                {{$f(`\n                    CO_2\n                `)}}\n            </span> as a result of organic fuel\n    burning.\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">    \n    Ecological Footprint envisages that in world\n    economy the people use resources and ecological\n    services from all over the world. Thus, the indicator\n    for a country may exceed its actual biological possibilities. On the basis of it, the essence of Ecological Footprint for a country is the extent of its consumption and global impact on environment.\n    The same methodology can be used for calculation (in the same values) of biological capacity of\n    the Earth, biological productivity of its territory. In\n    2017 biological capacity of the Earth was approximately 11.2 billion or 1.8 global hectares per capita\n    (non-human species were not considered). Now the\n    human need in biosphere, i.e. its global Ecological Footprint is 18.1 billion global hectares or 2.3\n    global hectares per capita. That is why, today global\n    Ecological Footprint exceeds biological capacity\n    of the Earth by 0.5 global hectares per capita. This\n    means that vital resources of the planet disappear\n    faster than the nature can renew.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2  ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    This threat has substantial correlation degree\n    with demographic structure change of the planet\n    population. For example, according to Human Development Report 2017 \n    the biggest growth of population over a period of the following 50 years is expected in \n    the poorest regions of the world: in Africa\n    it will become twice as big in Latin America and the Caribbean it will go up one-and-a-half times,\n    at the same time in Europe it will become 0.8 times\n    as less [4]. Essential threat is also uncontrolled increase in the urban population in underdeveloped\n    countries. By the year 2050 it will have been doubled approximately approaching to 10 billion people. It will lead to intensification of transport, ecological and social problems, an increase in criminal\n    statistics and other consequences of chaotic urbanization.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2  ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    The important tendency of the nearest decades\n    is rapid change in the structure of religious groups\n    of the Earth population. So, from 1980 to 2015 the\n    number of Muslims will increase from 16,5 % to\n    30 %, the number of Christians will decrease from\n    33.3 % to 31 %, the number of Hindus will decrease\n    from 13.3 % to 10 %, the number of Buddhists will\n    decrease from 6.3 % to 5 %.

Proliferation (NI).</b> «Proliferation» is a global threat of the nuclear\nwar, terrorism, the increasing number of weapons. It is a complex conception which is declared\nby many states and certainly is the part of modern policy. The level of the threat is opposite to\nvalue of Nonproliferation index defines degree of\nweapons nonproliferation and covers four categories of policy:\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"px-4 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n   1. Demilitarization or disarmament;\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-4 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n   2. Scientific Research;\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-4 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    3. State’s Development;\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-4 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    4. Level of Nonproliferation for Neighbor States.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    Each of these categories is formed by one or\n    two levels of indicators. These indicators, as well\n    as the methodology for calculating the Nonproliferation index, have been developed by World Data\n    Center for Geoinformatics and Sustainable Development [4].\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n    <span class=\"font-weight-medium\">\n        The first is Disarmament.\n    </span> The importance\n    of this category is underlined by Albert Einstein\n    words: «I do not know with what weapons World\n    War III will be fought, but World War IV will be\n    fought with sticks and stones.» Therefore, it is necessary to control the weapons usage and decrease\n    their number. The category of disarmament is also\n    identified by military expenditures. Being a very\n    specific category, its indicators should be revised\n    by the data from the open sources or by implicit\n    information. This category includes information\n    about nuclear and uranium production, because it\n    is necessary to keep in mind the possibility of nuclear weapons creation.\n</p>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n <span class=\"font-weight-medium\">The second category is Scientific Research.</span>\n It has three main directions: Education, Science and\nInnovations:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"mx-4\">\n    <li>\n        The education indicators describe the quality of education and the level of knowledge\n        through the financing and the enrolment of\n        students. Participation in Olympiads can\n        show the level of knowledge in comparison\n        with other countries.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The second direction is Science. It includes\n        such indicators as Scientific and technical\n        journal articles, Researchers in R&amp;D (per\n        million people), Research and development\n        expenditure (% of GDP).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        The last direction — Innovations — includes\n        indicators Patent applications, residents,\n        High-technology exports (current US$). As\n        a result, 9 indicators represent the category\n        Scientific Research.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n     <span class=\"font-weight-medium\">The third category is State’s Development.</span>\n    This category includes the following indicators:\n</p>\n<ul class=\"mx-4\">\n    <li>\n       Life expectancy at birth (years);\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Gross national income (GNI) per capita (PPP $);\n    </li>\n    <li>\n       Inflation, GDP deflator (annual  %);\n    </li>\n    <li>\n       Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita);\n    </li>\n    <li>\n       Sectorial structure of economy\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"px-2 ma-0\" style=\"text-align:justify\">\n     <span class=\"font-weight-medium\">The fourth category is Level of Nonproliferation \n     in Neighbor States.</span> This category shows the\n    risk to be engaged into some other states activities. The first indicator of this group is a conflict\n    barometer for neighboring states. This indicator is calculated by Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research [4] and published in annual\n    reports. It is necessary to find a quantitate measurement for relations between countries. It is clear\n    that if historically country has some conflicts with\n    neighbors, it restrains the nonproliferation. This indicator could be calculating in such way: first of all,\n    it could be 0 or 1 for each state. And the total sum\n    of the values will represent the historical factor of\n    relations. The time horizon must be limited, for example, by the newest history (from XX century).\n    It seems that this indicator partly crosses with the\n    previous one. But the conflict barometer should describe only the current situation.\n</p>\n\n</div>\n","script":""},"id":"t503jokwoia","activated":false}]},"gkvouvhssio":{"widgets":[{"type":"html-widget","name":"noname","icon":"mdi-language-html5","options":{"widget":{"visible":true}},"data":{"source":"embedded","embedded":"<div
